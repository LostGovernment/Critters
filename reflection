-------------------------------------------
For each of the following questions, 
focus on your plan and/or process for 
working through the assignment, rather 
than the CS concepts. Think about things 
like how you organized your working time, 
what sorts of things tended to go wrong, 
how you dealt with those errors or mistakes
___________________________________________

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?
I learned how to use class objects,
I learned how to use fields. Also, I learned 
how to implement constructors. I learn how
to use inheretence in my program with the 
key word extends. 


2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment?  How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?

I struggle during the creation of each 
of the command, such as, fighting, eating, and 
direction while they are not implemented in the spec. 

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?

I will create a class so that my program 
can be more dynamic. I will use fields, 
and utilize constructor in my program so 
that my program become more simple, and dynamic. 
I will use class to do automation to my program. 

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?

I think most of the specification is clear. 
Except, I just was not able to finish the program. 

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close.)

I spend about 5 hours on Monday, 
and 5 hours on Tuesday.
